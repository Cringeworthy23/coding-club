1. 
Verify that all installations are correct and everyone has Python 3.x.x and an IDE. Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a program that allows you to write code and run it.
2. 
Open Python Terminal and run basic math and variables. 
2a.
VARIABLES/PRINTING
print("Hello World!")
a = "Hello"
b = "World!"
print(a + " " + b)
Variables are flexible. other languages define type, but python does not. 
Change between them by: 
a = "1"
b = 1
print(a + b)
a = int(a)
b = int(b)
print(a + b)
a = str(a)
b = str(b)
print(a + b)
2b. 
Basic Math
3+3
3-3
3*3
3/3
3**3
a = 3
b = 3
c = a + b
print(c)
3.
Switch to IDE and start on loops
x = 5
if x == 5: 
    print("x is 5")
else: 
    print("x is not 5")
4. 
Input
x = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
print(x)
5.
Loops
x = 0
while x < 10:
    print(x)
    x = x + 1
    OR: x += 1
